1.1.4 - Jan 19th 2014:
[Change] modified pre() function to strip empty lines from ignore files, which if present, can cause all procs to be ignored
[Change] modified priority control files to be more granular: high, med, med-high, med, med-low, low
[Change] updated conf.prm to support CPUNICE/IONICE values for the new med-high and med-low prio levels

1.1.3 - Apr 27th 2012:
[Change] reordered process kill evaluation in the order of ETIME, PROCS, MEMORY, CPU
[Change] shell command paths now auto discovered through the which command for better
         interoperability between Linux flavors
[Fix] LOGGER path variable had an incorrect path prefix associated with it
[Change] MAX_PROC implicitly invokes hard fail state to combat quickly forking processes
[Change] logging data now stores to INSTALL_PATH/logs/
[Change] the prm action log previously located at INSTALL_PATH/log_prm is now located at
         INSTALL_PATH/logs/prm.log; symlink created to old path for compatibility
[New] created kill action log at INSTALL_PATH/logs/kill.log which records the time stamp and 'ps' output
      of all prm process kill actions
[Change] logging host mask no longer called through `hostname -s` on every log file transaction
[Change] deprecated the old -s|--standard cli argument, -c|--check is now the normal verbose execution mode
[Change] modified the -t|--top feature to include memory usage and overall kill stats
[New] added -s|--scores feature to display scoreboard of all kill events sorted by username
[Change] log files are now preserved through PRM upgrades

1.1.2 - Mar 14th 2012:
[Fix] corrected trailing white space on child_pidlist variable
[Change] all event output has been modified to a more consistent format making it easily
         parsable for statistical analysis and graphing
[Change] event output now includes the full command arguments for the 'cmd' field
[Fix] corrected sort priority issues with -t|--top feature
[Change] execution flow modified for better performance on I/O or CPU bound systems

1.1.0 - Jan 12th 2012:
[Fix] punctuation was being removed from the cmd value changing the expected command rules
      file names
[Fix] corrected excess line return feeding into the log file
[Change] disabled output when a process exits soft fail or disappears under PRM (terminates),
         it just served to spam logs and console
[New] added -l|--log to view prm log file
[New] added setnice() feature to set the IO & CPU priority of the top TOP_PROCS highest usage
      processes sorted by by CPU & MEM to [IO]NICE_TOP values, defaults to a medium-low prio
[Change] ignore processes with nice values less than 0 (RT) as these are either kernel processes
         or those set implicitly to real-time priority by the user
[New] added -t|--top N watch option to display top N (default 15) processes sorted by CPU & MEM
[Change] CLI flags -s|--standard changed to -c|--check, old flag support preserved 
[Change] MAX_MEM now accepts values in the format of: 1-99 is percentage of total memory,
         100+ is Mbyte resident set size (RSS)
[Fix] on clearing of stale lock files, prm would fail to update the current running pid
      and last execution time
[New] expanded spri functions to handle IO niceness priority scheduling
[New] integrated System Priority (SPRI) for CPU niceness priority scheduling
[New] added prios/ path containing high,med,low files for classing applications into respective
      priority groups
[New] added [IO]NICE_HIGH|MED|LOW|DEFAULT to conf.prm for configuring priority classing
[Change] modified ps output caching for improved performance
[Change] modified checked processes summary at program termination to include total run time

1.0.8 - Nov 11th 2011:
[Change] MAX_ETIME implicitly invokes hard kill state as it is an exponentially increasing value
         that will never come out of soft fail state
[Change] cli verbosity decreased slightly and a more graceful output format is now presented
[Fix] owner/permissions on installation files are now consistent

1.0.7 - Aug 14th 2010:
[Fix] removed exit on file not found for expr/bc as they are no longer used
[Fix] invalid nice arguments for ps cmd when populating $child_pidlist
[Fix] integer expression error fixed in kill_check()
[Change] ETIME value now shows full colon spaced value in alerts
[Change] CMD value now shows full command value in alerts
 
1.0.6 - May 24th 2010:
[New] complete rewrite of most functions and operating logic
[New] changed versioning scheme
      [MAJOR].[MINOR].[REV]
      1       0       6
[New] MAX_ETIME for setting max run time of processes
[New] string based, regex format, IGNORE variable for rules
[New] KILL_PARENT to kill parent pid and child processes
[New] KILL_SIG to set custom kill signals (kill -l)
[New] rule files now have a user and command based format
[New] command based global ignore file: ignore_cmd
[New] user based global ignore file: ignore_user
[New] top level /bin/ps output ignore file: ignore_pslist
[New] IGNORE_ROOT to ignore all root owned processes
[New] RULES_ONLY to ignore any process not matching a rule
[New] ALERT_ONLY to not perform any kills, send only alert
[New] KILL_RESTART_CMD to execute an after-kill command
[Change] rewrote entire README to reflect changes
[Change] moved project to GPLv2 licensing
[Fix] default cron permissions now set to 0644
[New] email alerts now generated from template: email.tpl
[Change] split internal variables into internals.conf
[Change] conf.prm is now better commented

0.5:
